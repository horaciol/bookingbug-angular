# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] - 2016-07-19
###Added
- Added helper methods to bbBasketList for displaying total price and tickety qty for grouped BasketItem objects that have events assoicated to them
- Added capability to edit BasketItem objects with events assoicated to them

### Changed
- Fixed issue where `current_item` was incorrectly set as the first item in the basket item rather than the most recently added one when updating the basket
- Fixed issue where selecting more tickets for the same event would make already entered ticket details available for edit again
- BREAKING: Updated `EventTicket` model with improved `getRange` method that takes account of tickets the user has selected when determing the valid number of tickets. Templates will need to be updated to pass the event to `getRange` method:

    <select ng-if="!selected_tickets" ng-model="ticket.qty" ng-options="n as n for n in ticket.getRange(event)">
      <option value="">-</option>
    </select>

## [1.4.0] - 2016-07-11
###Added
- New `Summary/Confirmation` step introduced in the default booking routing between the old 'summary' now 'booking questions' step and 'checkout' step

### Changed
- BREAKING: `src/core/javascripts/models/basket_item.js.coffee` renamed `getName` method to `getAttendeeName`. `getName` now returns the name of the service/event name associated with the basket_iten
- Updated `src/core/javascripts/models/basket.js.coffee` `readyToCheckout` method to check whether each individual basket item is ready

## [1.3.1] - 2016-07-07
### Changed
- BREAKING: Fixed issue in bbMemberLogin where form controller shared scope with login model. Templates where bbMemberLogin is invoked need to be updated to use the login object:

    <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required ng-model="login.password" class="form-control" />

## [1.3.0] - 2016-07-07
### Added

- Introduced bbTimeZone for displaying time zone information
- Added `show_time_zone` option to the `datetime` filter to show the time zone abbreviation

### Changed
- Updated `datetime` filter to use display time zone to format time
- Updated accordion range group to respect display mode (local time zone vs default company time zone
* Updated bbTimes directive and bbTimeRanges directive to use time slot datetime if available

### Removed
- Removed duplicate code from bbTimeRanges that sets the loc and "coffied" all the operators for consistency
